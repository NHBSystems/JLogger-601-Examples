# Beelan-LoRaWan Example
This is example shows how to use the JLogger-601 with the Beelan-LoRaWan library. It's a nice little library for a simplified application that just needs to get data to the server and maybe receive some downlinks. It does not however support MAC commands (yet?). This example also shows how to put JLogger to sleep between readings, and processing downlink commands.
